# Constraints
1. Time - there will be constraints on what capabilities can be added due to a limited amount of time. 
The team must organize the exisiting code before adding improvements to the app. 
There are certain features, like delivery capabilities, that will not be able to be completed in the two semesters of work. The team has prioritized the tasks needed to be done
to have a working application for students to use. However, lower priority tasks like adding a search bar may not be completed.
2. Social - this app is to be used by the Bearcats Pantry organization to benefit students who need food and hygiene products but can't afford them. The Bearcats Pantry already
benefits society in providing these products to students in need, and this stocker app will help BCP benefit the UC community even more. The BCP will be more accesible through
this app. The leaders of BCP will be providing requirements for the app, therefore there are constraints on what the team would individually want to add.
3. Security - as a web app that uses students' UC credentials to login and use the app, there are security concerns to keep in mind. It will be very important to ensure
students' personal information is not compromised in any way. Effort will be spent in security, constraining the amount of capabilities of the app that will be added.
