The Bearcats Pantry is an on campus service that provides free food, hygiene products, cleaning supplies and professional clothing to students in need. 
The goal is to help students that are struggling to meet financial needs for basic necessities that all students should have access to. 
The Bearcats Pantry is a great service that needs to be more accessible to reach all students that may need it. Currently, volunteers at the pantry have to 
manually keep track of inventory, which can be very tedious and take time away from more pressing needs that they could help with. 
Also, there is no way for students to check what is in stock at the pantry without physically going there. This could be problematic for students who donâ€™t have the 
time or funds to always go to the pantry, only for items they are looking for to be out of stock.

This project hopes to meet that need with the Bearcats Pantry Stocker Application. The goal of the application is to make the Bearcats Pantry more accessible to 
students and automate some of the manual processes that take place currently to maintain the pantry. This would help maximize value of the pantry so students know 
what they can get before arriving at the pantry while also removing tedious work for the volunteers and saving time.
