* As a student, I want to add desired products to a shopping cart and check out, so that I can receive the food and products I need to stay healthy.
* As a volunteer at the pantry, I want to fulfill in-person and online orders with the stock of products updating for both, so that I know what products are in stock when I check the app.
* As an administrator, I want to see which products are being purchased the most, so that the pantry can be more stocked with the most popular items and less stocked with the less popular items.
