## Abstract
The stocker application is a web application for students to use online before going to the pantry in person. A student is any student attending UC that can log-in through UC’s typical log-in page like in Canvas or Catalyst. A volunteer is anyone volunteering at the pantry, who may use the app to fulfill online orders and update stock, and use the app as in-person checkout. An administrator is any faculty member working at the pantry who can have access to data and reports regarding the pantry’s operations.
